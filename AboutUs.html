            <h2>Beginning</h2>
            <p>
            In the summer of 1993 "AMI" - a sports organization for Latvian vocational schools - had organized a sports competition. Workers from Tartu Technical School also happened to be visiting at the same time and they decided to join the competitions. Irena Bukovska (the leader of the AMI) had an idea to start sport games between the Baltic countries. After Irena met the representative of Estonian vocational education (Vladimir Sokman) she brought up the idea to him. The estonians agreed to take part and then only one country was missing - Lithuania. The summer of the same year Irena and Vladimir went to Lithuania to meet with Algirdas Pauliukonis, the Head of the Vocational Education Department of the Ministry of Education in Lithuania. Representatives of the sports club AMI and V.Sokman met in Mr Pauliukonis office and agreed to organize the Baltic States Sports Games for the students and teachers of vocational education. Then the first regulations of the sports games were discussed and written.<br>
            The Latvians agreed to host the first games. The 1st Baltic States Sports Games took place in Riga from 3-5 November 1993. They all agreed to only have a few sports events to compete in so as to cut the costs. The events chosen were basketball, volleyball and table tennis. Also a competition for the directors of the schools. The directors events were throwing darts, basketball freethrows and table tennis. Organizers of the event like to point out that the most memorable part was the enthusiasm of all the participants. Everybody agreed to keep the games going the next year.

            <h2>Second Games</h2>
            <p>
            The second Baltic Sports Games took place in 1994 26-28th May. Organizers decided to move the games to the springtime so participants had more time to prepare for it. This time the games took place in Estonia and they were held in the same buildings in which Tartu Vocational College operates today. The sports events were the same as last year except for the directors events where they changed the directors table tennis event to a competition in car driving! They thought that every school director should know how to drive a car. So they arranged a competition to see who could best maneuver the car. After that the games moved on to Lithuania. The games are still happening to this day!
